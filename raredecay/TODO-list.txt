- remove all "take_target_from_data" and replace by automatic checking (?)
- includes adjusted weights ratio... a lot to do
- possibility of updating weights (DONE?!) and targets instead of replacing
- clean root data handling, removing branches, write to etc.
- add save_to_root method to datastorage
- add combined weights/target return to storage
- plotting behaviour: importance 0 should result in no plotting at all
- HEPDataStorage: plot hists with different classes
- HEPDataStorage: before plotting, check if columns are the same
